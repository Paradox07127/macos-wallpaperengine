/// Main-thread delivery shim between `WPERenderSurface` (the AppKit-bound MTKView
/// owner) and `WPEMetalSceneRenderer` (the frame producer). The surface's
/// `draw(in:)` and drawable-size callbacks land here; the shim funnels each one
/// through a single async hop to the main actor instead of calling the renderer
/// inline.
///
/// Why a shim (the renderer is not `WPERenderSurfaceClient` itself): `draw(in:)`
/// is an AppKit callback that is *always* on the main thread, but the renderer
/// lives inside `WPEDisplayRenderActor`, which may be backed by a
/// dedicated render thread. The shim absorbs the hop: each surface callback is
/// delivered onto the render actor, where the renderer runs it.
///
/// Draw delivery depends on the actor's backing (passed at construction):
///
/// - `.main` backing: `draw(in:)` already runs on the actor's isolation thread
///   (the main thread), so the shim enters isolation **synchronously** via
///   `assumeIsolatedOnRenderThread` and renders inline. This restores the
///   invariant that `draw(in:)` returns only once the frame has been
///   produced — an async hop would have let `draw` return before the render ran.
///
/// - `.renderThread` backing: the render happens off the main actor, so the shim
///   uses an async, latest-wins hop. `draw(in:)` can fire faster than the render
///   thread drains; `frameInFlight` keeps at most one frame scheduled — a second
///   `draw` arriving while one is pending is dropped, not queued, because
///   `renderFrame` always reads the *newest* renderer state, so the already-
///   scheduled render presents it. The flag clears only once the actor finishes,
///   so a dropped draw's side effects (an appended live-poster continuation, a
///   fresh `outputTexture`) are always folded into the pending render.
