/// within-frame lifetimes do NOT overlap may share the same memory, while
/// targets that ARE alive at the same time never overlap. The lever that turns
/// "sum of every FBO" into "≈ peak concurrent". The GPU step (allocating the
/// heap + placing textures + hazard fences) consumes `Plan.heapSize` and
/// `Placement.offset`.

/// Algorithm: a classic time-ordered offset allocator. Intervals are placed in
/// start order (largest first on ties); each is given the lowest offset whose
/// memory range is free for the whole of its lifetime (i.e. doesn't collide
/// with any concurrently-alive, already-placed interval). Greedy first-fit —
/// near-optimal for these cascade-shaped lifetimes and always correct (it never
/// overlaps two simultaneously-live targets).
