# Feature Guide

**English** · [简体中文](../zh-Hans/features.md)

For setup steps, see [Quick Start](quick-start.md). For module ownership and
rendering data flow, see [Architecture](architecture.md). Edition availability
is defined by [ProductCapabilities.swift](../../Packages/LiveWallpaperCore/Sources/LiveWallpaperCore/Capabilities/ProductCapabilities.swift)
and the app target's build gates.

## App surfaces

- **Menu bar**: add a wallpaper, global on/off, per-display playback and volume,
  playlist navigation, CPU/GPU/RAM/thermal status, updates, settings and quit.
- **Management window**: Overview, Wallpaper Library, **Schemes** (saved display setups),
  System Wallpaper (macOS 26+), Workshop (Pro), and Settings.
- **Display editor**: Wallpaper and Overlays tabs. Overlays uses one canvas,
  a layer list, an object inspector and an add palette for widgets, clock and music;
  particles and weather response belong to the effect layer. Widget interaction
  receives clicks only over visible widgets; empty desktop areas stay click-through.
- **Guidance**: a floating Welcome Tour and contextual page guides highlight real controls.
- **Languages**: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Spanish.

## Wallpaper types

### Video — both editions

- `mp4`, `m4v`, `mov` and `avi`, subject to the codecs available to AVFoundation.
- Fill, Fit and Stretch; playback speed, mute/volume and video effects.
- Auto, sRGB, Display P3, Rec. 2020 HDR and force-SDR color modes.
- Independent display playback or a video spanned across displays.
- Configurable per-display RAM preload budget.
- A frame-rate ceiling with integer input from 1 to the display's current refresh
  rate, plus **Max**; supported presets include 15/24/30/45/60/120. The control
  shows the configured ceiling, not measured FPS. Video is also bounded by its
  source rate. Saved settings from earlier frame-rate formats migrate on load.

### Web — both editions

URLs, HTML files, local folders and inline HTML run in WKWebView. Settings
include JavaScript and mouse interaction, tracker blocking, custom CSS,
mute/volume, refresh interval, scale/pan/rotation and physical-pixel layout.
Workshop web imports use ephemeral storage and network isolation. User-created
web sources can use the network according to their settings.

### Apple Aerials — both editions

Browse, search and apply aerial videos macOS has already downloaded. Aerials
use the video playback path; Loomscreen does not download the Apple catalog.

### Wallpaper Engine scenes — Pro

Local project folders and downloaded Workshop content are read in place.
The native Metal renderer supports layered scenes, particles, puppet-warp
animation, text, SceneScript, audio response and cursor effects. Scene GLSL
is translated to Metal; it is not a separate wallpaper type.

Compatibility varies by project and feature. Import/preflight and runtime
errors describe unsupported content or missing assets; this is an independent
implementation, not a guarantee that every Windows project renders identically.
Windows executable wallpapers are not supported.

**Scene presets** store named values for a base wallpaper. Scene defaults,
a preset and per-display edits are separate layers. The Preset row offers
selection, save, rename and delete; Workshop detail pages list community
presets for the base wallpaper with a Steam Web API key, and link to them on
Steam without one.

Presets can also carry Wallpaper Engine color correction and volume. Color
correction runs as a full-frame pass when enabled and non-neutral; its curves
follow Loomscreen's video controls rather than claiming exact WPE parity.
Preset volume multiplies the display's volume. These engine settings are kept
separate from identically named project properties.

**Span All Displays** also works for scenes and stretches one scene across
displays. When a display joins or leaves, the scene is laid out again over the
displays that remain. Switching one of those displays to video or web takes it
out of the span. Applying a scheme never adds a display to a span. Fit, mute
and volume changes also reach span displays that are disconnected.

## Wallpaper transitions — both editions

**Settings → General → Wallpaper** holds two settings.

- **Wallpaper transition** plays when a display switches wallpapers. Choices
  are None, Crossfade, Meteor, Ink Bloom, Light Leak, Aurora Curtain, Light
  Weave, Ripple, Bokeh transition, Crystal, Blinds, Stardust and Random. The
  default is Crossfade.
- Ripple, Bokeh transition, Crystal, Blinds and Stardust distort a frame of the
  old wallpaper into a frame of the new one. Video and scenes can supply that
  frame. Web wallpapers and scenes spanned across displays cannot, so those
  switches use a crossfade instead.
- Automation switches use the same transition, played more slowly.
- **Opening animation** plays once on each display when launch restores your
  wallpapers. Choices are Off, Loom Line, Frame Unfold, Daybreak and Random.
  The default is Loom Line.
- When one action switches several displays, their transitions and openings
  start together.
- With Reduce Motion or Low Power Mode on, transitions become a short crossfade
  and the opening becomes a short fade-in.
- **Show wallpaper in screen captures** also applies to transition windows.
  When it is off, transitions stay out of screenshots, recordings and sharing.

## Bookmarks, schemes and automation

- **Bookmarks**: mark wallpapers you use often with the yellow bookmark, then
  pick the **Bookmarks** filter in the Wallpaper Library to list only those.
- **Likes** (Pro): the pink heart on a Workshop item keeps it to download
  later; the **Liked** toggle in the Workshop filter bar shows everything you liked.
- **Schemes**: a full display setup, including wallpaper, overlays,
  playback, effects, playlist and schedule. Applying a scheme replaces that
  display's setup after confirmation. Positions adapt to the target display.
  The particle and weather layer is not part of a scheme; applying one leaves
  it unchanged.
- **Wallpaper Automation**: a sheet opened from the display's top bar, with
  three modes — Playlist, Daily Schedule and Library Shuffle.
- **Playlists**: videos, web pages and (Pro) scenes, drag-reordering, shuffle,
  and rotation every 1, 5, 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes, or manual.
- **Schedules**: time slots, conflict checks and fallback to the primary
  wallpaper. Automation pauses during lock/sleep and reconciles once on wake.
  Slots sit on a **24-hour schedule** dial. Drag the ends of a slot's arc to
  change its hours; double-click an empty hour to add a slot. **Unscheduled
  Hours** sets the wallpaper for hours no slot covers.
- **Library Shuffle**: picks a random wallpaper from the whole library at the
  chosen interval. New imports join automatically. The same wallpaper never
  plays twice in a row. **Next Random Wallpaper** skips ahead.
- **Skipped wallpapers**: a wallpaper that fails to load is retried once, then
  skipped. The sheet lists each one with its reason — missing file, failed
  load or load timeout — and **Enable Again** brings it back.
- The rotation countdown starts over when you pick a wallpaper yourself, apply
  a scheme or apply a Workshop item (Pro). While you are away (lock or display
  sleep), playlist and shuffle countdowns freeze and later continue from what
  was left.
- A wallpaper on an unmounted volume is passed over for that turn. It is not
  marked skipped.
- **Shortcuts**: play/pause, next, previous, mute, mouse interaction, global
  wallpaper visibility, reload and settings — eight configurable actions.
- **Backup**: `.lwconfig` carries configurations, global settings, bookmarks
  and schemes, plus Workshop likes in Pro. It does not package media files, Steam credentials or API keys.
  File grants are machine-specific; files may need to be selected again after
  moving a backup. Lite keeps the scene displays of a Pro backup but cannot
  play them; the import summary counts them.

## Overlays

Overlays have per-display configuration and can accompany video, web or scenes.
Particles and the monitor/music layers can also run over the macOS desktop
without an active Loomscreen wallpaper session. The particle and weather layer
belongs to the display: it stays when you clear the wallpaper. The display's **Overlays** editor
shows widgets, clock and music together on one canvas, with shared placement,
selection and object controls; particles and weather response use the effect layer.
See [Workspace](workspace.md#arrange-overlays).

- **12 particle effects**: Snow, Rain, Bokeh, Fireflies, Dust, Stars, Leaves,
  Sakura, Mist, Embers, Bubbles and Meteors. Includes wind-aware effects,
  Reduce Motion handling and screen-capture visibility control.
- **Weather response**: Open-Meteo conditions drive particle selection and
  video adjustments, using system or manual location.
- **Monitor board**: eleven widget types — System Overview, CPU, Memory, GPU, Network, Disk, Power,
  Processes, Agent Session, ANE Memory and Weather. Widgets have supported
  small/medium/large sizes, drag arrangement, display scaling, options and
  layout import/export. The board can sit at the desktop or above windows.
  Unavailable readings are distinguished from zero; histories retain sampling
  gaps. Network/disk totals are monitoring-session estimates.
- **System Overview**: one medium or large instrument panel for CPU, memory,
  GPU, network throughput, disk I/O and power. Large adds history curves and
  optional temperature/fan readings. Uses the existing shared sampling pipeline.
- **Clock**: an independent, transparent Nixie clock with a metal base and glass
  separators. Drag to place and freely resize it; choose 12/24-hour time, hour
  leading zero, opacity and separator blinking. It has its own display switch
  and layer, and pauses while hidden without starting metric samplers.
- **Weather widget**: a sky scene with condition/place caption, day/night
  appearance, clouds, precipitation and wind. It is separate from the
  display-wide weather-response controls.
- **Agent Session**: reads local Claude Code and Codex session records for
  status. ANE Memory reports memory, not neural-engine utilization.
- **Music / Now Playing**: independent Poster, Vinyl and Aurora layouts,
  cover-derived accents, drag placement and optional lyrics. Pro adds system
  audio-driven visual effects, including Wave, when Audio Response is enabled.

Track changes come from Spotify/Apple Music notifications, with a startup
state read when needed. Apple Music's missing playhead is queried through
Apple Events while the source is active, so progress and synchronized lyrics
can follow it when Automation permission is granted. Playback buttons and
seeking use the same permission boundary. Without a usable playhead or timed
lyrics, the display falls back rather than inventing timing.

Cover art and optional LRCLIB lyrics use HTTPS host allowlists, response-size
limits and caches. Lyrics are off by default. Preview artwork uses cached
content; it does not independently fetch a second copy.

## Performance and display lifecycle

The playback state machine keeps user play/pause intent separate from system
policy. Lock/sleep, critical memory pressure and critical thermal state are
safety suspends. Full-screen, window occlusion, battery, Low Power Mode and
per-app rules are configurable policies; **never pause** app rules only veto
the discretionary policies. Menu-bar and display status explain pause reasons.

Moderate thermal pressure reduces scene/web frame rates and can suspend video.
A manual pause retains a still frame and enters deeper resource hibernation
after the dwell period. Pro adds adaptive scene frame rates and per-display
render actors. Display configuration persists.

A manual pause, from a display or the global toggle, persists. It holds through
property edits, automatic rotation, unplugging and reconnecting the display,
and relaunch. Pressing play, or picking a wallpaper for that display, clears
it. Configuration backups do not carry the pause.

Video and local web wallpapers, and in Pro scenes from a Steam library, can live
on an external drive. When that volume is unmounted, the display keeps its
configuration. When the volume mounts again, the affected displays reload on
their own.

## Workshop — Pro

- Browse with paging, cache, maturity/type/resolution/genre/Miscellaneous
  filters and translated tags. Maturity starts at Everyone, matching what the
  signed-out Workshop page shows; the Questionable and Mature chips turn those
  ratings back on. Sort names, time windows and the search-field
  menu (Title & Description / Title Only / Description Only) use Steam's own
  wording; the default sort is Most Popular over one week and can be changed
  in Workshop settings.
- Public browsing works without a key and reads the page's own result data,
  so keyless cards carry author names and page counts. A stored key that Steam
  rejects switches browsing to the public path with a dismissible notice.
- Creator names load after initial results, and existing cards remain visible
  while filters refresh. Genre choices match any selected genre; Miscellaneous
  choices must all be present; tag/creator scopes retain the other filters.
- Detail pages show posted/updated dates, rating and comment counts, required
  items, grouped tags and links to the item's change notes, comments and
  collections on Steam.
- **Show presets as wallpapers** is off by default. Presets remain available
  through their base wallpaper's detail page.
- Steam setup supports managed SteamCMD installation, automatic detection and
  manual selection. The XPC connector verifies the tool and runs SteamCMD.
- In-app sign-in supports Steam Guard and cached accounts. Sessions are kept
  per account; downloads go to the authorized Steam library. Subscription sync
  makes subscribed items available in the app.
- **Downloads** on the Workshop page lists each download with its progress,
  speed and stall state. You can cancel a download. A failed download stays
  in the list after a restart, so you can retry it.
- Downloads are revalidated inside the authorized library before import;
  app-managed deletion and download mutations share repository coordination.
- Shared Wallpaper Engine assets can be linked or installed, with update checks.
- The library keeps one entry per Workshop item. If a scene imported from a
  local folder is also present as a Steam download, the Steam item takes its
  place at launch and after the download. Displays, bookmarks and schemes that
  used the local copy switch to the Steam item. The local folder stays on disk.
- Downloading such an item yourself first asks **Replace the copy in your
  library?**
- Importing a folder whose Workshop item is already in the library from another
  folder is refused. Folder imports report how many items they skipped for
  this reason.

## System Wallpaper — both editions, macOS 26+

The **System Wallpaper** library copies supported video files into the
provider's library. Choose them through macOS Wallpaper settings; the provider
can keep playing when Loomscreen is closed. This is a video-only system path,
separate from Loomscreen's scenes, web pages and overlay windows. The page
reports provider compatibility and can pause publishing on an unsupported
macOS build. See [Architecture](architecture.md#system-wallpaper-provider).

## Updates and privacy

Both editions use Sparkle with separate HTTPS appcasts and signed update
payloads. Scheduled checks can show Sparkle's update dialog; the menu-bar
Update button and About page also expose the update flow. Sparkle handles
download and installation, including relaunch. Automatic checking is controlled
in General settings. This is not a GitHub-API notification-only checker.

No Loomscreen account or usage telemetry is required. Optional online features
contact Steam, weather, artwork/lyrics or update services; remote web wallpapers
can contact their own sites. New Steam API keys are saved in the login Keychain;
legacy owner-only files are migrated after a verified Keychain write and can
remain when migration is refused. See [Security](../SECURITY.md) and
[permissions](install.md#system-permission-prompts).
