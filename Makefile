# Every build registers its .app — and the wallpaper appex inside it — with
# LaunchServices, and the newest record displaces the installed app's. Observed
# 2026-09-01: /Applications/Loomscreen Pro.app was not registered at all, while
# 16 build directories were. WallpaperAgent instantiates every registered
# provider on each discovery pass, so these are also what it spuriously launches.
# The processes retire themselves (ProviderStaleness); this clears the records.
#
# Driven off pluginkit, not `lsregister -dump`: pluginkit lists exactly the
# wallpaper-extension providers, so nothing else in the database is touched.
# lsregister surfaces an older record whenever a newer one goes, hence the loop.
#
# Deliberately NOT part of `verify` — a gate must not mutate the machine's
# LaunchServices state.
